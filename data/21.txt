"bot": Hello!

"bot": Okay, let's start! First, I need some information about your current mobile phone plan:
"bot": Who's your current mobile phone provider?
"user": superMobile
"bot": Okay. Which mobile phone plan do you have?
"user": yellow basic 1000
"bot": How much did you pay in total last month?
"user": 32.29
"bot": Got it. How many minutes have you spent on the phone last month (national calls)?
"user": 652
"bot": How many text messages did you send last month?
"user": 23
"bot": How much data did you use last month?
"user": 1450
"bot": Do you often travel outside of Europe?

"bot": Sorry, I didn't understand. Please answer 'yes' or 'no'.

"bot": Okay, final question: How much are you willing to spend on a mobile phone plan per month?
"user": 25
"bot": Thanks, here are your information again:
"bot": Currently, you pay 32.29 € for a superMobile yellow basic 1000 plan. Last month, you spent 652 minutes on the phone, sent 23 messages, and used 1.45 GB of data. You often travel outside of Europe. In total, you don't want to pay more than 25 €.
