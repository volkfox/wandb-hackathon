"bot": Hey there!
"bot": I'm a chatbot that helps you find a new mobile phone plan. What can I do for you?
"user": hi, I need a cheaper solution than my actual plan which has total charges of about 30€
"bot": Okay, let's start! First, I need some information about your current mobile phone plan:
"bot": Who's your current mobile phone provider?
"user": SuperMobile
"bot": Okay. Which mobile phone plan do you have?
"user": Yellow Basic 1000
"bot": How much did you pay in total last month?
"user": 32.29
"bot": Got it. How many minutes have you spent on the phone last month (national calls)?
"user": 652 minutes
"bot": How many text messages did you send last month?
"user": 23
"bot": How much data did you use last month?
"user": 2GB
"bot": Do you often travel outside of Europe?
"user": yes
"bot": Okay, final question: How much are you willing to spend on a mobile phone plan per month?
"user": €25.00
"bot": Thanks, here are your information again:
"bot": Currently, you pay 32.29 € for a SuperMobile Yellow Basic 1000 plan. Last month, you spent 652 minutes on the phone, sent 23 messages, and used 2 GB of data. You often travel outside of Europe. In total, you don't want to pay more than 25 €.
"bot": Is that correct?
"user": yes
"bot": Alright, I'm looking for a better plan for you now. Stay tuned!
"bot": So, here is the best plan for you: SmartTalk offers a plan called Blue XL for 22 € per month. It comes with unlimited national calls and 50 inclusive international minutes, but without any free text messages. You would also get 3 GB of high-speed data!
"bot": Sounds good? I hope I could help you find a better mobile phone plan. If you want to try again, you can ask me anytime. Have a nice day!
